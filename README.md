# Grammar Correction System using NLP

A **Grammar Correction System** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that detects and corrects grammatical errors in input text — similar in spirit to tools like Grammarly and other GEC (Grammatical Error Correction) systems.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## ⭐ Features

- ✔️ Detects and corrects grammatical errors in text  
- ✔️ Spell checking and correction  
- ✔️ Suggests improved sentence structure  
- ✔️ Built with Python and NLP techniques  
- ✔️ Interactive Jupyter Notebook demo included

## 🧠 About the Project

This project demonstrates how natural language processing techniques can be used to **analyze and correct grammatical errors** in written English. The system can be extended with ML/DL models for deep learning approaches like sequence-to-sequence or transformer-based models.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
